July 9th, 2004. The day my world gained its sunshine.\n\nDarling, I'm already thinking about how to make that day absolutely magical for you. It has to be fit for a queen, because that's exactly what you are to me.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd want to do or anything special that would make that day even more unforgettable?
